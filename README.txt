Blink Vision

Blink Vision is an application built in Python that helps prevent eye strain, thereby helping in prevention of Computer Vision Syndrome related issues. 

This application monitors the user via their webcam and notifies them as per the duration set by them.

If the user does not blink enough times (i.e. lesser than the ideal rate of 15-20 blinks per minute), the application prompts them to take a break and rest their eyes.
